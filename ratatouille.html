                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>This game, which was created for a Communications Lab final project, is a retelling of Disney's classic movie, Ratatouille, in a game format.</p>

                    <h2 style = "color: #FFF;">Context</h2>
                    <p style = "color: #FFF;">The narrative is inspired based off the climatic scene in Ratatouille, where Ego, a tough food critic, visits Linguini’s restaurant. You play as Remy, who is puppeteering the chef Linguini. In the scene, Ego arrives and orders “perspective,” which is meant to confuse the player as Linguini was confused in the moment. The player is allowed to ask two clarifying questions before Ego stops answering, although his answers are brief and unhelpful. When the player enters the kitchen, Remy provides some helpful instructions telling the player to grab prepared food from the refrigerator and cook it on a stove. The player can take the food off the stove at any time and give it to Ego to judge — you don’t know whether he will enjoy food or not.</p>
